## **Context:**

This is a remix of Get Stuy, which was adapted from Get MIT, which was then adapted from the original 2048, but no worries. This is now and will now remain the best publicly available ediiton of 2048 you can get your hands on!

## **Changes:**

Nothing extraordinary: Changed the color scheme to primarily blue, updated the background, and swapped the Stuyvesant HS logo for the Brooklyn Tech HS logo.

## **Instructions:**

Execute the index.html file.
This should open up on a browser with proper formatting and the JS-rendered 2048 table. If this does not appear, there may be a problem with your environment. This is commonly encountered when this is opened up on a smartphone. Therefore it is recommended that you use a desktop computer for this. 

Additionally, if the file does not work, your OS or default browser may be lacking critical architecture and/or dependencies. Try updating your OS / default browser or upgrading your PC.
If your computer does not have a browser installed, you are likely running linux (given that your computer is modern enough). You can install a browser in the Linux terminal with "sudo apt-get install (browser)"

**Good luck!**
